This project will serve as your introduction to PyTorch, the library used in this class to construct neural networks and train/use them efficiently. The project will walk you through constructing a custom Dataset class and an iterable DataLoader for training your model. Next, you'll instantiate the layers of your model and complete the forward pass to make predictions on whether a headline is from the Onion, a satirical news site, or real. Once you've built your model, you'll define the training and validation loops, as well as three metrics for your models performance.

The PyTorch documentation will undoubtedly be a great tool for this project as will all comments and instructions (we really think you should read them). If you're unfamiliar with PyTorch we'd strongly recommend spending some time looking at the embedded links to find good starting points for each stage. There's a lot of comments and instructions, but we think these should cover most basic questions.
